This is a three-day "client project" completed as part of a group in week 8 of Dev Boot Camp. This was our first full rails project.

The goal of the project was to meet with one of the teachers as a "client" who would lay out their needs for a site. We would only be able to meet with the client once per day, and at the end produce a product that satisfied the client's changing demands.
